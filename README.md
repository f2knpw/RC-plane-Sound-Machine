# RC-plane-Sound-Machine
A friend of mine wanted a realistic RC plane warbird with "engine" and "machine gun" sounds.  Throttle stick will startup the engine, then sound will realistically change with the throttle until you fully stop the motor. Additionnally a button can trigger machine gun shots !
